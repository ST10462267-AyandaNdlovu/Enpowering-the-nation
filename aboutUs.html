        <p> This company, founded by Precious Radebe, provides skills training
             and upskilling programs for domestic workers and gardeners. The training
              enhances their employability, market value, and enables them to start their 
              own businesses. Employers can also upskill their employees through these programs.

             Empowering the Nation was established in 2018 and offers courses in Johannesburg.
             Hundreds of domestic workers and gardeners have been trained on both the six-month 
             long Learnerships and six-week Short Skills Training Programmes to empower themselves
              and to provide more marketable skills.</p>
